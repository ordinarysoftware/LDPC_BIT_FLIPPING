# Binary Hard Decision-Decoding Algorithm with Bit Flipping

## Overview

This documentation details the implementation and visualization of a binary hard decision-decoding algorithm with bit flipping. The algorithm corrects errors in received bits through parity-check equations and is accompanied by a visualization software using vis.js.

## Representation using Tanner graph 


Tanner graphs are one of the ways to represent LDPC, which were introduced by Micheal Tanner [3] who considered Robert Gallager’s LDPC codes, and his structured codes using a bipartite graph called a Tanner graph. A simple undirected graph G: = (V, E) is called a bipartite graph if there exists a partition of vertex set so that both V1 and V2 are independent sets. We often write G: = (V1 + V2, E) to denote a bipartite graph with partitions V1 and V2. A Tanner Graph for an LDPC code is a bipartite graph in which the nodes can be partitioned into two classes and no edge can connect from the same class. The two classes of Tanner graph are “variable nodes” corresponding to n bits in a codeword, and “check nodes” corresponding to m parity check equations.

The parity-check matrix H of an LDPC code is a key element in Tanner graph visualization of LDPC codes. Given the parity-check matrix in equation 1, the corresponding Tanner graph is shown in figure 2

## Definitions
Symbol node degree is the number of edges connected to a symbol node, which is the number of ones in the column of the parity check matrix corresponding to that symbol node. Check node degree is the number of edges connected to the check node which is the number of ones in the row of the parity check matrix corresponding to that check node. The symbol degree is a sequence degree list containing the symbol node degrees of all symbol nodes or number of edges symbol node can have. The symbol node values are a sequence value list containing the symbol node values of all symbol nodes. The check degree is a sequence degree list containing the check node degrees of all check nodes. Girth is the length of the shortest cycle in the Tanner graph

## Algorithm

### Binary Hard Decision

The binary hard decision for each received bit is done by the detector and forwarded to another decoder.[1] In this algorithm, the messages are transmitted through the Tanner graph edges and a symbol node sends a message finalizing if it is one or a zero, and then each check node sends a message to each connected symbol node by finally declaring what value the symbol node is based on the information available to the check node. The check node in this step finds that if the modulo-two sum of the input symbol node values is zero, its parity-check equation is satisfied.[1]

However, the symbol node flips its current value, if most of the messages gotten by a symbol node are not the same as its received value. This process requires iteration where the algorithm is repeated until some maximum number of decoder iterations has executed and the decoder terminates, or until all the parity check equations are met. 
This process makes the flipping algorithm a hard decision-decoding algorithm.
In the bit flipping algorithm first function requires XOR the input messages bits at symbol nodes every time to check check nodes’s parity check equations. Another function is required to check whether to flip the bit or not to get the correct message.

The Second step is to flip the bit that is incorrect which was detected in the second function in step one and iterating through them helps to flip incorrect bits in symbol nodes.

## Visualization Software

- Utilizes vis.js for dynamic graph representation.
- Real-time updates of Tanner graph during decoding process.

## Implementation Steps
The implementation is composed of three files main.js, BFP.js, and tanner-graph.js. The main.js contains input values, and the function calls on the button click to submit and view the graph. The tanner-graph.js contains the Tanner Graph class and it only acts as an abstraction for the algorithms implemented on BFP.js also vis.js visualization functions renderer and prototypes. A Tanner graph is represented by the corresponding parity check matrix. Each symbol node values, symbol degrees, and number of check nodes are stored as well as the edges between them. A Tanner graph can create intermediate graphs from itself for the given node, which is a clone of the original Tanner graph. 

BFP.js contains the actual bit-flipping algorithm and other supporting functions such XOR calculating function, dictionary reverse function, symbol node values update function. XOR calculation function calculates current XOR of symbol nodes connected by edges to check node. Symbol values update function which is implemented inside modularchecksum updates values of symbol nodes if XOR is not 0. Its BFP.create method should be called with the relevant parameters such as n, m, symbol node values array, and the symbol node degrees array. The return value is a Tanner Graph object representing the final graph after the successful execution of an algorithm. There is also the BFP.hook method which registers a callback function to be hooked into the edge addition step to see values change over steps.

BFP.js also allows hooking into the edge creation step to inspect intermediate states while the algorithm is running. You can pass a callback function to the BFP.hook which will be called each time an edge has just been added. For instance, this code prints the current parity check matrix to the console each time an edge is added by the BFP algorithm:
